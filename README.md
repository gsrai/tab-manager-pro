# tab-manager-pro
Chrome extension for managing tabs into groups for deferred consumption

### To Do ###
- reload grouplist when uploaded
- id should be based on tsp as if i rename group, id is same, so i can create group with same name and then delete resulting in both groups being deleted
- deploy app!

#### Phase 2! ####
- rewrite in cljs
- create a testable, mockable wrapper around chrome api
- archive deleted groups
